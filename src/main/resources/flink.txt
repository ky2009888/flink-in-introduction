Maven Dependencies
Apache Flink
You can add the following dependencies to your pom.xml to include Apache Flink in your project. These dependencies include a local execution environment and thus support local testing.

Scala API: To use the Scala API, replace the flink-java artifact id with flink-scala_2.11 and flink-streaming-java_2.11 with flink-streaming-scala_2.11.

Update Policy for old releases
As of March 2017, the Flink community decided to support the current and previous minor release with bugfixes. If 1.2.x is the current release, 1.1.y is the previous minor supported release. Both versions will receive bugfixes for critical issues.

Note that the community is always open to discussing bugfix releases for even older versions. Please get in touch with the developers for that on the dev@flink.apache.org mailing list.
